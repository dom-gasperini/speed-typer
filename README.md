# Speed Typer by Dominic Gasperini

## Program Summary:
This program is a typing tester! It provids the user with a random prompt and then times how long the user takes to fully type the prompt. It then calculates the accuracy of the user and how many words per minute the user can type at. It allows you to save your results to a text file and even allows the user to upload their own file with custom prompts! 

## Concepts Used:
### Module 2:
- I/O Stream: reading from a file
- I/O Stream: writing to a file
### Module 3:
- N/A
### Module 4:
- Mouse Input: various buttons and other click-able items on the GUI
- Keyboard input: the typing test portion of the GUI
- Integrating with C++ Class: the Typer Class reads and writes data to and from the GUI 

## Systems Used:
- Pop!_OS 22.04 on a Dell XPS 15 - running in Qt Environment & from program installation


## Installations:
### For Working in Qt:
- Qt 6.3
- Qt Creator
- Qt Installer Framework

### For a User:
